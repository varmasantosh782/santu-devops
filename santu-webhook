Jenkins Redhat Packages
To use this repository, run the following command:

WARNING: The gpg key use to sign our packages has been updated on 16th of April 2020, therefore you need to reimport it if you imported before this date.

  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
  
If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the rpm --import will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.


  yum install jenkins
  
The rpm packages were signed using this key:

pub   rsa4096 2020-03-30 [SC] [expires: 2023-03-30]

uid                      Jenkins Project 
sub   rsa4096 2020-03-30 [E] [expires: 2023-03-30]
You will need to explicitly install a Java runtime environment, because Oracle's Java RPMs are incorrect and fail to register as providing a java dependency. Thus, adding an explicit dependency requirement on Java would force installation of the OpenJDK JVM.
